## OpenLANE
OpenLANE is an automated RTL2GDSII flow which comprises many other EDA tools out there, for eg. Yosys, OpenSTA, Netgen, Magic etc. The main idea of OpenLANE is to have a complete and clean RTL2GDSII flow without any human intervention. OpenLANE is tuned for Skywatrer 130nm opensource PDK and can be used to produce hard macros and chips.
