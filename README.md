# VsdSky130_openLANE
VSD Sky130 Physical Design is a 5 days workshop where I learn about opensource EDA tool "openLANE". This is a documentation of the labs perfomed by me on this workshop.
## OpenLANE
OpenLANE is an automated RTL2GDSII flow which comprises many other EDA tools out there, for eg. Yosys, OpenSTA, Netgen, Magic etc. The main idea of OpenLANE is to have a complete and clean RTL2GDSII flow without any human intervention.
